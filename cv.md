## Summary
I'm studying in Yanka Kupala State University of Grodno in my third year. My goal in RS School is to learn a lot of new features of JS and React, that will help me find job in this area. I think, I can consider my perfectionism as my strength.

## Skills
* C#, a little bit .NET
* HTML
* CSS
* JS basics

## Code examples
My solution for [Fake Binary](https://www.codewars.com/kata/fake-binary/javascript) task from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)

```javascript
function fakeBin(x){
  let result = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    result = `${result}${+x[i] >= 5 ? '1' : '0'}`;
  }
  
  return result;
}
```
